      "For organic treatment of tomato blight, I've had success with a mixture of baking soda, vegetable oil, and water. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, and a few drops of liquid soap in 1 gallon of water. Spray this on your plants every 7-10 days.\n\nAlso, make sure you're practicing good garden hygiene - remove all affected leaves and don't compost them. Mulch around the plants to prevent soil splash, and water at the base rather than overhead.",

The initial cost is higher than some systems, but the water savings and improved crop health make it worth it in the long run.",
